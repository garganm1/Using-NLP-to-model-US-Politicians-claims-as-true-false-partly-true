# Using-NLP-to-model-claims-as-true-false-partly-true
The project focuses on implementing Natural Language Processing on a dataset consisting of claims and a list of articles supporting those claims, thereby developing a supervised machine learning model that will be able to predict the measure of truthness of each claim from one of the three categories namely "True", "Partly True" and "False".  Extending further, considering the claim labels in the dataset as "ground truth", we analyse the predictions of claims made by prominent US politicians to deduce the degree of fake news being spread.
